<h1>
- # Credit Card Validator
</h1>
<p>
  This is a <b>Java program</b> that validates credit card numbers based on specific criteria:
- The program checks if the credit card number has between 8 to 9 digits.
- It performs validation using steps like reversing the number, doubling specific digits, and summing them up.
- A constructor is used to initialize the credit card number, and methods handle each step of validation.
- If the validation is successful, the card is marked as "Valid," otherwise, it is "Invalid."
This project demonstrates the use of core Java features like string manipulation, loops, and basic arithmetic operations.

- # Alphabet War Game
</h1>
<p>
### Description
The **Alphabet War Game** is a simple Java-based game where letters from two teams (left-side and right-side) battle against each other based on predefined or customizable strengths. The game determines the winner between the two sides, or if it's a tie, based on the total strength of each side's letters.

### Features
- **Constructor Overloading**: The game allows you to use either the default strengths for each letter or customize them through the constructor.
- **Method Overloading**: You can play the game by inputting a single word or separate words for the left and right sides.
- **Interactive Gameplay**: Users can enter letters for both sides and play multiple rounds to see who wins.
- **Predefined Test Cases**: The program includes sample test cases that automatically run when the game starts to validate the logic.

### How to Play
1. Run the program.
2. Enter letters for the left and right sides when prompted.
3. The program will calculate the winner and display the result.
4. You can continue playing by typing "yes" when asked, or exit by typing "no."

### Test Cases
The following test cases are included:
- `AlphabetWar("z")` => Expected Output: Right side wins!
- `AlphabetWar("zdqmwpbs")` => Expected Output: Let's fight again!
- `AlphabetWar("wwwwwwz")` => Expected Output: Left side wins!
