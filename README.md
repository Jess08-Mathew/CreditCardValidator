<h1>
- # Credit Card Validator
</h1>
<p>
  This is a <b>Java program</b> that validates credit card numbers based on specific criteria:
- The program checks if the credit card number has between 8 to 9 digits.
- It performs validation using steps like reversing the number, doubling specific digits, and summing them up.
- A constructor is used to initialize the credit card number, and methods handle each step of validation.
- If the validation is successful, the card is marked as "Valid," otherwise, it is "Invalid."
This project demonstrates the use of core Java features like string manipulation, loops, and basic arithmetic operations.
